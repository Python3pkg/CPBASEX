pBASEX Abel Transform Inversion without Polar Rebinning... in MATLAB and Python

Inversion code for MATLAB and Python is available in the CpBASEX folders, while the example directory has examples of how to calculate the integrals needed for the inversion (saveGData) or invert some sample images and plot the results (basicAnalysis).

A full write-up on Abel inversion, pBASEX in general, and details of this particular implementation will be available soon...
